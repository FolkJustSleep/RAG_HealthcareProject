# RAG_HealthcareProject

As Thailand transitions into an aging society, the demand on medical personnel continues to grow, raising concerns about long-term healthcare capacity. 

To help address this challenge, we developed an AI agent system designed to assist medical professionals by providing contextual, accurate responses using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.
  
Our AI agent can be applied in various healthcare-related scenarios, such as answering patient queries, assisting with medical documentation, and supporting decision-makingâ€”all based on domain-specific data.  

This system uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ground AI responses in a custom knowledge base, allowing for flexible, updatable, and context-aware answers. By enriching the AI with more relevant data, its performance and accuracy improve over time. 

<h2> GET STARTED </h2>

Create Virture environtment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
